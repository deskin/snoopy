## Summary
By analyzing the orbital parameters of 2018 AV2 we approximate the next closest Earth approach to be "20 August 2041" (+/- 1 day). We find an approximate Hohmann transfer window open between "1 April -- 1 June 2041" and arrival between "1 November 2041 -- 1 January 2042" with Earth-departure "$C_3 < 1 km^2/s^2$" and rendezvous "delta-V $< 500 m/s$". This can be used for evaluating project feasibility, further refinement of orbital dynamics, and initial constraints on spacecraft selection.
